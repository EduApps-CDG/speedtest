# Requirements
&#8226; A reasonably fast web server. PHP is optional but recommended.
&#8226; Some way to generate garbage data (PHP script included, see doc.pdf for other solutions).
&#8226; Your server must accept large POST requests (up to 20 Megabytes), otherwise the upload test will fail.
&#8226; It's also better if your server does not use compression, but it's not mandatory.
